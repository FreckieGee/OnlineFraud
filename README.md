Online Fraud Model
Fraud is a billion-dollar business that expands massively year by year. A lot of people fall victim to it despite the awareness organisations try to raise. Fraud always includes a false statement, misinterpretation, or deceitful conduct. Common varieties of fraud offenses include identity theft, insurance fraud, credit/debit card fraud, and mail fraud.

Payment type
Putting fraud under control is really an issue particularly for the financial and commerce industry. The number of transactions has increased due to a variety of online payment options, such as credit or debit cards, smartphones payment applications, online payment sites, etc. At the same time, cybercriminals have become adept at finding and exploiting ambiguities or inadequacy of the online payment systems. As a result, it is getting tougher for businesses to authenticate and approve transactions.
